# NoSQL-Challenge

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the UK Food Standards Agency dataset to assist the Eat Safe, Love food magazine in identifying key insights about food hygiene ratings. The project utilizes MongoDB for NoSQL database management and Python with PyMongo and Pandas for data processing and analysis.

## Skills Utilized
**1. MongoDB NoSQL Database Management**
* Importing JSON data into MongoDB.
* Performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
* Executing aggregation pipelines to analyze data.
* Using regular expressions ($regex) to filter data.
* Updating data types in MongoDB using update_many().

**2. Python and Data Analysis**
* Using PyMongo to interact with the MongoDB database.
* Querying data and transforming results into Pandas DataFrames.
* Cleaning and preprocessing data.
* Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with pprint and Pandas.

**3. Data Transformation & Cleaning**
* Converting string values to numeric data types (integer, float, decimal).
* Removing irrelevant or duplicate records.
* Ensuring data consistency in geospatial queries.

**4. Data Aggregation & Query Optimization**
* Using count_documents() for record counting.
* Sorting and grouping data using aggregation pipelines.
* Filtering data efficiently with $match, $group, and $sort operations.
* Finding nearest establishments using geospatial queries.
